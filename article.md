# Getting started with Supply Chain Insights APIs

IBM's Supply Chain Insights provides your organization with end-to-end visibility throughout all stages of the supply chain lifecycle - starting from planning and sourcing, all the way to delivery and service, and everything in-between. Not only that but Supply Chain Insights is a collaboration platform; it enables businesses to set up resolution rooms to discuss and take action on problems that inevitably arise during the supply chain process. Now, Supply Chain Insights, like any other artificial intelligence application, is only as good as the data that you give it. To make things simple, Supply Chain Insights allows for two ways to upload data into the platform - one via Excel sheet upload, and the other, which will be the focus of this article, via REST APIs.

Next, click on the user icon in the top-right corner, and then click on My IBM. Next, scroll down to your trials, given that you have activated your learning environment. 
Note: after you request access for your trial account, it takes up to one business day to deploy your environment. 
Given that you have taken the first step and set up your Supply Chain Insights account (if you have not, go here), and have taken a quick tour around the platform, you are now ready to start uploading some data. Let's dive into how to first get your API keys.
