## 1. Get an IBM ID

The first step to getting your free trial of Watson Supply Chain Insights (WSCI for 
short) is to get an IBM ID. First go to [ibm.com](https://www.ibm.com) and in the 
top-right corner, click on the icon of a person. From there, click on **My IBM**. 
From there, click on **Create an IBM ID** and fill out the form. Note that the 
email you use here will need to be valid, since you will be emailed your trail 
account for WSCI to the email you use to create your IBM ID. Now that you have 
created your IBM ID, let's request your WSCI trial.

# 2. Get a Watson Supply Chain Insights trial account
To get a Watson Supply Chain insights trail account, we must first register 
for a course that gives us access to this account. Let's go to 
[IBM Training and Skills site](https://www.onlinedigitallearning.com/course/index.php). You will likely be asked to login with your IBM ID. Once there, 
search for **DL25400G**. You will see a couple results, click on 
**IBM Supply Chain Insights: Getting Your Learning Environment**. Inside the 
course, you will see a few links, click on **Requesting your learning environment**.
From there, fill in the form with your IBM ID email, and then click on 
**Create Request**. The request must be processed by IBM, and can take **up to 
one business day** to complete. I.e. if you request it on Friday, you may only get 
access to your account on Monday. Once you get your email granting your access 
to your WSCI trial, we are ready to get started! 

# 3. Upload existing orders and shipments from spreadsheet
Our first exercise upon getting our WSCI account is uploading data from a 
spreadsheet. Go ahead do a git clone to download all of the files from 
the repo, which includes the Excel spreadsheets.

```
testDir$ git clone https://github.com/horeaporutiu/watson-supply-chain-insights

testDir$ cd watson-supply-chain-insights/ 
```

You'll see in this repo, that we have the **product-spreadsheet.xlsx** 
and **product-inventory.xlsx** files. First, let's update the spreadsheets
to use our own initials instead of **RTA**. Update the files, and save 
them. Since my initials are HP, my spreadsheet will show 
**HP-SA-2019-V1**.

Now, log into [IBM Supply Chain Insights](https://www.ibm.com/customer-engagement/supply-chain/launch/) with your IBM ID and 
password you created in step 1.

From the left-hand panel of the WSCI dashboard, click on **Data**, which
is right above the **Settings**. From there, click on **Upload**. From 
there, navigate to **product-inventory.xlsx** from within your cloned
repo. You should see something like `This upload is similar to files that were previously uploaded. Select one of these mappings?
You can edit the mapping or make a copy if necessary.` Go ahead 
and click on **Select a type** under the main panel which shows 
11/12 fields matched. Then select **Product Inventory**. You should 
see a pop-up which says **Time to map your upload!** Click on `Continue`.

Then, under **Your data fields** click on **Select an option** and click 
on **Inventory Location**. On the bottom, you should see **11/12 mapped**.
Click on **Next**.

The next page will say **Your data is uploading**. Click on **View History**.

There, at the top of the page you should see **product-inventory**. If you
click on the right-arrow, you should see **8 records processed**. Nice job!

You now know how to upload data through Excel spreadsheets! 

# 4. Get API Credentials

APIs for WSCI enable you to load, update, and delete data. The first 
thing we need to do before we can use the API is to get our credentials.

We need three credentials:

1. X-IBM-User-Secret
2. X-IBM-Client-Id
3. X-IBM-Client-Secret

To retrieve the first two, from the WSCI home dashboard, click on
**Settings -> Build info**. From there you should see 
your **X-IBM-User-Secret** and **X-IBM-Client-Id**

To retrieve the **X-IBM-Client-Secret**, click on **RESTful APIs**
under API access. This will take you to the WSCI API explorer page.
Click on **My APIs** in the top-right corner. To the right of 
**Supply Chain Insights** you'll see a key icon, go ahead and click
on that. Once you click the icon, you'll see two sets of credentials
one with a lock icon, and one with a key icon. If you hover over the 
key icon you can see it says **X-IBM-Client-Secret** - then click 
**SHOW** and save your **X-IBM-Client-Secret**.

# 5. Use APIs to automate uploading of data to Watson Supply Chain Insights
Let's first go to the WSCI [API documentation page](https://developer.ibm.com/api/view/scinsights-prod:supply-chain-insights:title-Supply_Chain_Insights#doc). From there, let's try out first API request to find customers. 
In your cloned repo, you should see a script that is called
`getCustomers.js`. This script, along with a lot of the other scripts
we will run, use the base api 
`https://api.ibm.com/scinsights/run/api/`, but this one in specific 
looks to get all of the customers we have stored in WSCI. This is 
why the URL we will make a API request to is the following:

`url: 'https://api.ibm.com/scinsights/run/api/customers'`

Our script uses the [HTTP request client](https://github.com/request/request) package to make API calls. It also uses the [fs](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/doc/api/fs.md#fswritefilefile-data-options-callback)
module to write the output from the API request to a file. 

Note that all of the output files will be created in the `output` 
directory, which at first, is empty.

At the top of the file, we import the `request` and `fs` libraries
with the following code:

```javascript
const request = require("request");
const fs = require('fs');
```

Next, we create an object which holds the options to our API request:

ðŸš¨
**Note: You will have to update the client secret, user secret, and user id fields with the credentials you got from [step 4](#4-Get-API-credentials).**
ðŸš¨

```javascript
var options = { method: 'GET',
  url: 'https://api.ibm.com/scinsights/run/api/customers',
  headers: 
   {
     'content-type': 'application/json',
     'x-ibm-client-secret': 'your-client-secret-goes-here',
     'x-ibm-user-secret': 'your-user-secret-goes-here',
     'x-ibm-client-id': 'your-client-id-goes-here' 
    } 
  };
```

Once you've updated your credentials, the object should look 
something like this (P.S. the credentials below are fake):

```javascript
var options = { method: 'GET',
  url: 'https://api.ibm.com/scinsights/run/api/customers',
  headers: 
   {
     'content-type': 'application/json',
     'x-ibm-client-secret': 'yD4cI3jO8tE3wN7hO2fG0wBashdjkfF5uY7cQ4wM6lQ6oX8pN1bA8iF',
     'x-ibm-user-secret': 'a6f24afafaf52c909cec34',
     'x-ibm-client-id': '9e12d666-b1fsfa4b-4211-21b4asdf' 
    } 
  };
```

The last part of the script uses the library to make an HTTP API call
to the WSCI API and then once we get the data back from our API call
the callback function will fire, as shown below:

```javascript
request(options, function (error, response, body) {
```

Inside of the callback, we write back the body of the response
to the `output/getAllCustomer.json` file:

```javascript
  fs.writeFile("output/getAllCustomers.json", body, function(err) {
    if(err) {
        return console.log(err);
    }
    console.log("The file was saved!");
  }); 
```

Now that we understand how we are making the request, let's 
go ahead and run the script [getCustomer.js](https://github.ibm.com/ibm-developer-emerging-tech/watson-supply-chain-insights/blob/master/getCustomers.js)

```javascript
watson-supply-chain-insights$ node getCustomers.js
The file was saved!
```

If we go to the file, we will see it's all on one line. Let's
format it by selecting the line, right-clicking and selecting 
**format document**. If all went well, you should see a document
with over 300 lines, something that looks a bit like the following:

```json

Note that this is all dummy data, but WSCI comes with some dummy
data out of the box to show you what it can do. Let's now 
go ahead and put some of our own data into WSCI.





<!-- ## Extending the code pattern
